# LatteX ☕

**Math, Y'all** — LaTeX math rendered to SVG, for the JVM.

LatteX is a clean-room, pure-**Java 25** library that renders LaTeX math to **SVG** — inline and display, baseline-accurate — with **zero runtime dependencies**. No JavaScript engine, no headless browser, no external `tex` binary. Point it at `\frac{1}{2}` and get back a crisp, scalable, self-contained `<svg>`.

```java
String svg = com.lattex.api.LatteX.render("\\frac{a+b}{c}");
```

## Why

The JVM lacks a modern, permissively-licensed, web-first math renderer. KaTeX and MathJax are JavaScript. JLaTeXMath is excellent but old (AWT/image-first) **and GPL**. SnuggleTeX is permissive but limited to MathML. LatteX fills that gap: **Apache-2.0, pure Java, SVG-native.**

## Design

- **Java 25, modern.** The math tree is a `sealed interface` + `record` algebraic data type, laid out with exhaustive pattern-matching switches — no visitor boilerplate.
- **Zero runtime dependencies, framework-free.** No Spring, no anything. A JPMS module you drop in and call. The glyphs come from a bundled OFL math font (STIX Two Math), emitted as SVG `<path>`s — so there are no fonts to load in the browser either.
- **SVG-native, inline-capable.** Output is a minimal, sanitizer-friendly SVG subset — only `<svg>`/`<g>`/`<path>`/`<rect>`, with glyphs as inline filled `<path>`s (no `<text>`/`<use>`/`<defs>`/`<script>`). The renderer exposes each expression's height and depth so inline math sits correctly on the text baseline.
- **Native-image clean.** No reflection; ships GraalVM reachability metadata, and an optional standalone `lattex` native CLI.
- **Design-for-both, ship SVG.** A layout core + pluggable output backends (mirroring TeX's own `dvisvgm`/`dvipng` driver split): SVG today, an optional raster backend later.

## Status

Early but real. The parse → layout → SVG pipeline is wired end-to-end: `com.lattex.api.LatteX.render(...)` renders fractions, roots, scripts, big operators, and delimiters to SVG today. The `\lx[...]{...}` author syntax, inline em-sizing + baseline alignment, `fx` effects, and a click action menu (Copy / Graph) are built too. (These currently live on review branches, merging to the mainline soon.) See **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** for usage and cross-stack integration.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Requires a Java 25 toolchain (Gradle provisions it via the toolchain spec).

## Contributing

LatteX is a **clean-room** implementation. Before contributing, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — in particular the rule that we implement from the *primary sources* (Knuth's TeXbook + the OpenType/SVG specs), **never** from other renderers' code.
